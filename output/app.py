To create a Streamlit app in a module named `app.py` that imports necessary modules and provides a Business Intelligence Dashboard with the outlined features for CSV uploads, I will now write the code for `app.py` to integrate with the given backend logic and create charts using Plotly within a Streamlit application environment. This app will allow users to upload a CSV and visualize the results accordingly.

Here is the code for `app.py`:

```python
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
from dashboard import DashboardApp  # Assuming dashboard.py is your backend module

# Function for uploading CSV file
def upload_file():
    uploaded_file = st.sidebar.file_uploader("Upload a CSV File", type="csv")
    if uploaded_file is not None:
        data = pd.read_csv(uploaded_file)
        return data
    return None

def main():
    st.title('Business Intelligence Dashboard')

    # Upload data
    data = upload_file()

    if data is not None:
        # Create an instance of the DashboardApp class and pass the data
        dashboard_app = DashboardApp(data)

        # Display Key Metrics
        st.header('Key Metrics')
        total_revenue, total_profit, customer_count = dashboard_app.key_metrics()
        st.metric('Total Revenue', f'${total_revenue:,.2f}')
        st.metric('Total Profit', f'${total_profit:,.2f}')
        st.metric('Customer Count', customer_count)

        # Plot Sales Trend
        st.header('Sales Trend Over Time')
        sales_trend_fig = dashboard_app.sales_trend()
        st.plotly_chart(sales_trend_fig)

        # Plot Top 5 Products by Revenue
        st.header('Top 5 Products by Revenue')
        top_products_fig = dashboard_app.top_5_products_by_revenue()
        st.plotly_chart(top_products_fig)

        # Plot Revenue Share by Region
        st.header('Revenue Share by Region')
        revenue_share_fig = dashboard_app.revenue_share_by_region()
        st.plotly_chart(revenue_share_fig)

        # Plot Profit vs Cost
        st.header('Profit vs Cost per Product')
        profit_vs_cost_fig = dashboard_app.profit_vs_cost()
        st.plotly_chart(profit_vs_cost_fig)
    else:
        st.write("Please upload a CSV file to proceed.")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This Streamlit application allows users to upload a CSV file, processes the data using the `DashboardApp` class, and displays the required visualizations with interactive Plotly charts. The app structure ensures that the user is guided to upload a file if none is provided on the app sidebar.
